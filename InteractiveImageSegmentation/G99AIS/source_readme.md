## Requirements
GPU memory >= 4GB for inference on Berkeley and GrabCut. Optimal performance around 480p resolution.

#### Packages:
- torch >= 1.4
- numpy
- opencv-python
- [guided_filter_pytorch](https://pypi.org/project/guided-filter-pytorch/)
#### Additional Packages for jupyter notebook
- matplotlib


## Models
| Model Name  |     File Size   | NoC Grabcut  | NoC Berkeley |
| :------------- |------------:| -----:|----:|
| [SyntheticPretrained+Finetune on SBD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJMTXSlprm5FQaQA5gfyU8CbSEX8ghzJ/view?usp=sharing)  | 144mb | 1.74 | 2.93  |


## Prediction 
We provide a script `demo.py` which evaluates our model in terms of mean IoU and number of clicks to reach 90% accuracy. Links to download: the [GrabCut](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FFBH4vArby8alggT0SKjXPW7F8ShjXTp) and [Berkeley](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1atKWE4IY4FKFaNHsn-l7kbEo8T2z3MPx) datasets. Results are slightly improved from Table. 8 in the paper, this is due to changes in prediction, the weights are the same as used in the paper.


## Training
Training code is not released at this time. It may be released upon acceptance of the paper.
